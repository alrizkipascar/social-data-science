      "Why take out Olympus and kings canyon but keep 2 of the worst maps in the game and force feed them down everyone‚Äôs throat, not even gonna play until Olympus worlds edge and kings canyon are back at the same time, oh no it‚Äôs just sooooo hard to have 5 maps at once or just take up broken moon and storm point as a loss and delete them forever the same way you do kings canyon, honestly embarrassing what apex has come to now\n",

      "What about removing storm point and broken moon for being way too big and not enough teams to fill the maps and also playing on those maps feels like a chore and that‚Äôs not fun I usually wait the 2-2 1/2 hrs before only playing 1hr on worlds edge and then waiting another 2 1/2 hours to play again those big maps need to be removed and reworked and add more teams only on big maps kings canyon and worlds edge are perfect for the 20 teams but 20 teams on the others just simply isn‚Äôt enough there‚Äôs more looting and running to find enemies when there‚Äôs none to go after ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n",
