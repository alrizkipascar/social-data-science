      "What about removing storm point and broken moon for being way too big and not enough teams to fill the maps and also playing on those maps feels like a chore and that’s not fun I usually wait the 2-2 1/2 hrs before only playing 1hr on worlds edge and then waiting another 2 1/2 hours to play again those big maps need to be removed and reworked and add more teams only on big maps kings canyon and worlds edge are perfect for the 20 teams but 20 teams on the others just simply isn’t enough there’s more looting and running to find enemies when there’s none to go after 🤷‍♂️\n",
